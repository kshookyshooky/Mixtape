<p><b>Lyrics</b><br>
  Babylon burn burn burn.<br>
  Sojah representing.<br>
  We dream of this wonderful time,<br>
  Now we want a reality,<br>
  Where we can smoke marijuana every day without no√ø apologies,<br>
  And even when we eyes them red like blood babylon can't pene we,<br>
  Cause a da healing of the nation,<br>
  And H.I.M. no want no aggravation.<br>

</p>

<h3 id="oxygen">"Oxygen" by Dirty Heads</h3>
<p><b>Lyrics</b><br>
  Tornado, I see you coming around<br>
  Don't let go, you know I'm holding you down<br>
  People shouldn't change like the weather, man<br>
  People shouldn't change if they innocent<br>
  People act strange when it's getting out of beat<br>
  So let me be your oxygen<br>
  Please don't go, I will stay<br>
  When everyone is leaving, and you're feeling strange<br>

</p>

<p><b>Lyrics</b<br>
  Two in the morning, police knockin' at my door, what for?<br>
  Never know the reasons they be coming packin'<br>
  And then they're coming through I tell them "He just kick down my door"<br>
  Even though I'm on the floor with a gun to my head.<br>
  All the reason that I'm holdin' all the trees<br>
  And I gotta a lot a weed<br>
  They be spottin' me with infa-red<br>
  In the mood and I'm, " who the hell is you?"<br>
